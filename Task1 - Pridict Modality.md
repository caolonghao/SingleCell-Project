# Task1 - Pridict Modality

## Overview
The original information of this competition, including much of the information here, can be found online at https://openproblems.bio.

## Files and Modules
- `scripts/data_reader.py`: Handles reading and preprocessing of `.h5ad` files used for training.
- `scripts/model.py`: Contains the logic for building and training models. You can modify this file and replace it with your own methods.
- `scripts/evaluate.py`: Provides functionality to evaluate the model's predictions against ground truth data.
- `config.py`: Stores configuration settings, including file paths for input data.
- `main.py`: The main script that integrates all modules and runs the data processing pipeline.

## Getting Started
1. **Setup**: Ensure all dependencies are installed. This project requires libraries like `anndata`, `numpy`, `scipy`, and `sklearn`.
2. **Configuration**: Update `config.py` with the correct paths to your `.h5ad` data files and any other necessary settings.
3. **Running the Project**: Execute `main.py` to start the data processing and analysis pipeline.

## Usage
- Use `scripts/data_reader.py` to read and preprocess your data.
- Modify `scripts/model.py` to adjust the model building and training process.
- Use `scripts/evaluate.py` to assess the accuracy of your model.
- Update `config.py` for different datasets or parameters.
- Run `main.py` to execute the entire pipeline.
